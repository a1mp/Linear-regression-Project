# Linear-regression-Project
Predictions made based on half of the data points of short sub-datasets

The United Nations Sustainable Development Summit, where the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development  and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted, was held from September 25-27, 2015. The 2nd of the 17 goals is the subject matter of this project (End hunger, achieve food security and improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture).

The prevalence of undernourishment, as a share of the population, is the main hunger indicator used by the UNâ€™s Food and Agriculture Organization (Roser 1). The data frame used has the Percentages of the prevalence of undernourished part of the population by Entity from 2001 to 2019. According to Roser, this goal of the UN is far from being achieved.

The project aims at producing both the accurate individual visualization of UN Member States and that of prediction using a Linear regression model while answering few questions in the way.

The Dataset I used can be found by visiting https://ourworldindata.org/  or  via this link: https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment#too-little-height-for-age-stunting.
